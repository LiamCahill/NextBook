This is a simple Python project to demonstrate use of the 
Selenium Python module.

The program reads in the a book title from the text file
stored within the same directory, and then opens a browser 
(currently configured for Google Chrome version:88.4324.150)
and searches that book title on Amazon.

Future ideas:
- check to see if Chrome is installed
    - if so, what version
    - grab the respectable webdriver, either via wget() or if the program ships with it.
- create a GUI, maybe with GOOEY module
